      " How he was found: Bobby was abandoned and was roaming around our neighbourhood one rainy afternoon - all the kids were mad happy upon his arrival. People played with him, but, as night came and heavy rain poured in, all the doors were shut and nobody let the dog in. He was begging for shelter from house to house. Bobby's conditions (health, behaviour, friendliness & etc.): Bobby is a friendly dog who enjoys being petted and brushed. He is also very playful and he requires being taken out for a walk everyday. When we first found him, his health was at a very bad stake. He smelled bad and his fur all matted. He had sensitive stomach - he suffered from diarrhoea during the first week and couldn't digest kibbles. We fed him boiled chicken/liver and very soft rice for a fortnight and now he can eat anything (healthy for a dog). I trimmed his fur the first week and brush him on a daily basis. Now he looks as charming as the ones at a dog show. We noted several behavioural problems caused by the previous owner. In other words, Bobby's owner had abused him and kicked him out of the house. Several issues were observed, e.g. Bobby is shit scared of broom stick and he shows aggression as we wear slippers in front of him (was beaten by the previous owner with broom stick/kicked with shoes on). He doesn't trust strangers (especially adults); but with patience and obedience training and a lot of treats (what we did), now he jumps around us shaking his tail happily all the time. Why we couldn't let him stay We are a cat-lover family and we currently have 2 cats at our household (more are coming). As much as I love Bobby and try to help him, my cats show strong objections and disagreements against having a dog in our house. In the end of the day, I believe Bobby deserves a better/more experienced dog owner. Terms and conditions: There is no adoption fee and no money involved. You could take him to your home as long as you agree to/that - 1. Take him out for (at least) a walk everyday 2. Brush him on a daily basis, otherwise Bobby would have a matted fur 3. Strictly NO punishment in any form. You can correct him if he does anything wrong, but - you have to understand that he was abused by his previous owner and doesn't trust human a bit, therefore he regards punishment, aggression and violence differently - so, no punishment. What we do is that when he does something right, we give him treats and praise him (a little bit of drama and exaggeration involved); when he does something that we don't like, we show him that we don't like it and ignore him for a while. He wants to please you, so he will do anything if it makes you happy and avoid letting you down. For more details, kindly give me a call at during daytime.\n",

It's really a bad time because I'm leaving to the Netherlands on 9th August, but hey, I can't leave her there when there's stray dogs running around. So it's been 3 weeks she's staying at my place and she's learnt how to use the litter box. I'd very much like her to find a loving family to continue to provide her with affection and care. She's very playful and her favourite toy is a wine cork tied to a string. After a long day's playing she'll fall asleep on your lap while you're watching TV or reading emails. Stroking her hair can be very relaxing and therapeutic after a long day. She'll open her eyes occasionally to check if everything's alright and fall asleep again. After Meow is fully recharged with adequate sleep and yummy in her belly, she can run around the house at the speed of light to prove herself worthy of another playing session. Before you know it, you'll be in love with this hairy this creature. She has been dewormed and got her first vaccination. She needs another 2 vaccinations before she can be spayed.</td>\n",

She loves dog and is very attached with one of the community dog - Bobby. Bobby is a sweet and friendly dog too and she gets along well with Pinky and the cats. Unfortunately past two weeks Pinky dissapeared for two days and she was found with severe injuries on her back side and it bleeds badly.

Poor Pinky is still hospitalized in vet clinic. The vet are forced to cut off her long beautiful tail as the tissues and skin of the tail were damaged. We're worried that after she got back to the back alley she might got bite again as she's too friendly with dog. Pinky definitely deserves a very good and loving home.

But she still need a proper place especially a landed property or garden she can run around. And she will bark and make noise one day and condo is not a place for her.

       "      <td>Michi was found badly injured two weeks ago, with two big dog bites going through his fur, into his chestbox, very close to his lung and spine, with an serious infectious process going on, in a farm some hours away from KK. Neglecting him would have meant leave him to a slow and painful death. I looked after the cat, and his recovery's been great, but still under antibiotic as the biggest holes hasn't sealed completely, hopefully he'll be healed by the end of this week. I am a traveler, and I must leave Malaysia as my visa expires. We've come all the way to KK to find a real home for him, as I am not allowed to cross into other country with the cat. Michi is male, small size, half-short tailed, about 3 years old, and healthy (no skin deseases). He is quiet, sweet, adorable, not picky with his food, and most importantly LOW MAINTAINANCE. It's hard for me to leave him, as he's the most caring thing I have seen in cats. We had great adventures: we hitch-hiked for two days from somewhere near Tawau, to get here. So you can add \"well traveled\" to his qualities. I must leave KK by Sat 11th Aug. Still after this date, please contact me, as I may not have found a place for him. Do you think you can give him a second chance? You can also help by sending this page to your friends Have a look at more pictures of Michi Terima Kasih!</td>\n",

       "      <td>For Adoption 🌻Lassie🌻 Spayed Female, approximately 18 months old Great with kids, a bit cheeky with cats and loves food a bit too much for her own good Needs more work on the leash (if she sees something she is curious about, it's like being dragged by a tractor) Lassie was dumped in Puchong a few months ago and Stanley Saw Boon Leong tried to ignore her like the many strays in the area but could not help but intervene when it became obvious that Lassie, an ex pet, had no idea how to survive on the streets. After falling very ill with tick fever and being attacked and mauled by the strays in the area, Stan and his wife decided she had to get of the streets. I am fostering Lassie and she has been with me for about 2 months. She loves other dogs and will have no trouble going to a family with other dogs. She will chase nervous cats but does not hurt them. Confident cats who stand their ground get their due respect. She is beautiful; I think a cross between Border Collie and Labrador. She learns fast and is eager to please. She is calm indoors but can walk and run for hours if you're the active type. She may knock small children over with her enthusiasm but there isn't an ounce of malice in her and this will subside with age. Moreover she prefers to snuggle up and nap with her people. If you can provide an indoor home, regular walks and exercise, patience to train her and occasional treats AND You are looking for a unique and beautiful family pet who will love you unreservedly, please get in touch at #adoptdontshop #adoptme #adoptionsaveslives #yoycantbuylove #foradoption</td>\n",

       "be10ae529  These 2 pets were rescued form the bushes nearby Second Chance shelter at Old Klang Rd. They were covered with cat fleas , but after a good Frontline spray by the rescuers, they looked very alert and healthy. Both of the pups were very pretty and though initially they were wary of people but they warmed up to us in a short time. Please give them a lovely home, they deserve more!

       "3210b7021  A cute, friendly, timid boy. He is very playful,very affectionate and has the cutest tiny meow. He is not a vocal one, only meowing softly when he is hungry. He is adjusted to living with other kitties or dogs in the house. He loves hugs and cuddles. His fur is soft and silky smooth, medium length hair. Has the cutest orange button nose. Found him outside my office meowing and begging at passerby, maybe abandoned. I can't keep him as I have too many animals in the house,. He is toilet trained. Does not use claws when playing. Loves climbing the gate or trees. His favourite toy is anything that roles on the floor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "3b068ba06  She's extremely loving and such a well behaved cat. When I first saw her she was roaming in my condo pretty much going to everyone for a lil pat and attention. In couple of days she came to my unit. I fed her and send her back to the management, told them to find out the owner and pass her to them. Clearly they did not. She found my house again. This time I went to management spoke to a few people and try to find out myself. Went from units to units and no one claims her. Her claws been trimmed, very clean and she's so comfortable in my house. Based on how she is, it's very obvious she belongs to someone but no one is coming forth to claim her. I sincerely believe she would make an amazing pet. I have two dogs on my own and she's not getting along in with them or else I would love to keep her. Please call, leave a text or whatsapp ().

       "2fb04c8d1  I found Meow on the side of the street and decided to take her home as she was all alone and so super tiny. It's really a bad time because I'm leaving to the Netherlands on 9th August, but hey, I can't leave her there when there's stray dogs running around. So it's been 3 weeks she's staying at my place and she's learnt how to use the litter box. I'd very much like her to find a loving family to continue to provide her with affection and care. She's very playful and her favourite toy is a wine cork tied to a string. After a long day's playing she'll fall asleep on your lap while you're watching TV or reading emails. Stroking her hair can be very relaxing and therapeutic after a long day. She'll open her eyes occasionally to check if everything's alright and fall asleep again. After Meow is fully recharged with adequate sleep and yummy in her belly, she can run around the house at the speed of light to prove herself worthy of another playing session. Before you know it, you'll be in love with this hairy this creature. She has been dewormed and got her first vaccination. She needs another 2 vaccinations before she can be spayed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "8075da3a6  I found Mimi as a small, fragile kitten in the parking lot of Menara Pinang several years ago and he grew into a beautiful and affectionate cat. We gave him a girl's name because his \"package\" was so small we thought he was female. We kept his name because he knew it. Sometime later we got a Shih-Tzu and a small Westie terrier. Mimi does not like the dogs and has been unhappy since. He is much more introverted around the dogs than he was before.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "560a38b5c  Rainbow was found by myself locked up in an empty house without food & water. I have went through alot trying to rescue her and am currently fostering her. Although Rainbow is estimated 8 yrs old, she behaves like a puppy, playful, active, full of curiosity. Rainbow mixed very well with human as well as furkid, she's very friendly to other dogs, never seen her chase cats before and she's also very manja towards human. Rainbow is not at her best state of health, that's why i am looking for an adopter who's ready to give her as much love & happiness for her these last few years. If you are interested and a serious adopter, please contact me and i will walk you through Rainbow's history.

       "e317b2a73  Rocco is an adorable beagle. My wife bought her to me 4 years ago, almost when we just arrived. Rocco loves to be among people, she's very playful and excellent to get along with cats since she has grown up with couple of them. Unfortunately I'm moving and I cannot bring her with me. It's really heartbreaking but I have no choice. Rocco is partially trained, understands \"sit\", \"stay\" & \"down\". Always at night we go out to take a short walk and play for a bit ( min) and then I feed her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "2c007007f  Kris was found attempting to cross a busy road all by himself. We brought him home and have been looking after him. He is looking for a loving and caring home. Kris is a happy and playful kitten. He enjoys playing with his toys and climbing things. He is affectionate and loves to be cuddled. His favorite playmate at the moment is Rapunzel, a little puppy who was also rescued. Please contact me if you are interested to adopt him. The home he goes to should be one that will give him the care, affection and security that he deserves. We are willing to provide transportation to his new home if necessary. We are also willing to sponsor neutering if finances are an issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "d1a2da8ef  POSTED ON BEHALF OF OUR FRIEND MANDY. please kindly contact her directly if you wish to adopt: . TQ :) Pinky is one of the community cat that our friend-Mandy taking care of. Pinky lives at the back alley of her house and she feeds the group of cats daily. Pinky is a very very adorable, sweet, friendly, manja and tame cat. She loves dog and is very attached with one of the community dog - Bobby. Bobby is a sweet and friendly dog too and she gets along well with Pinky and the cats. Unfortunately past two weeks Pinky dissapeared for two days and she was found with severe injuries on her back side and it bleeds badly. It was diagnosed as dog bite wound and we believe that Pinky might got bite by other stray dogs around that area..she might think that dogs are all as friendly as Bobby and would play with her. Poor Pinky is still hospitalized in vet clinic. The vet are forced to cut off her long beautiful tail as the tissues and skin of the tail were damaged. We're worried that after she got back to the back alley she might got bite again as she's too friendly with dog. Pinky definitely deserves a very good and loving home. Please, adopt her if you're able to. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - Always keep cat indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat him like your own precious family members Please give a home to Pinky ♥                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "62bf39bdf  Lucy is a young siamese mixed kitten. Dog rescuer Rena found her wandering alone on a busy highway recently and immediately brought her home and out of harm's way. Unfortunately Rena can't keep Lucy permanently because she has other pets and other foster animals. Can anyone give this sweet litle girl a safe and loving home? She has been dewormed and given a clean bill of health by Rena's regular vet. If you want to be that special person in Lucy's life, please call RENA at-. Serious enquiries only please.

       "2dc54e9fd  This stray mom suddenly came up to my balcony and gave birth in my kids' toy box.. Already 2 weeks and we have been feeding it.. I can't keep it as I have a dog and am not always at home to care for it. THe neighbours are complaining as well as this mother invites many 'boyfriends' and goes around pooping in neighboring houses(but not in mine ;p) . I really hope mom and baby will get a nice home... Baby is currently 2 weeks old (born on 16th Jan )..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "4cc67e8b3  Stolichnaya, Stoli for short, was found by me almost 3 years ago in Pahang. As her foster mom I was able to find a new home for her. Unfortunately, 2 years later, the person who adopted her is leaving Malaysia and cannot take her with him. She is in Muar with him and looking for her new and FOREVER home. She is great with kids and other dogs. I was told that she is OK with cats so long as they aren't skittish. She is an excellent guard dog, and very territorial of her home space. The adoption fee will be used as a donation to a local rescue group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "af9325798  Sunny was born to a litter of 4 pups of a stray mixed breed mom. She was rescued underneath an abandon car called home as her tiny head was stuck in the car's metal bar or something and she was unable to free herself. I guess she was stucked there for almost 2days or so coz after I freed her, she kinda stumble in her walk. Then I realized she's blind as there is no reaction in her eyes movement when my fingers go near her eyes and she walk without direction. I took her in hopefully to adopt her permanently but I am staying in condo. And about a week plus or so, I noticed that she can actually see because she was following my cats around. I thought its because she can hear them or smell them, but no its not. SUNNY IS NOT BLIND! That was a good news. And now she is super naughty and enjoys playing w the cats and eats w them. But she still need a proper place especially a landed property or garden she can run around. And she will bark and make noise one day and condo is not a place for her. So if you are interested to adopt this adorable kecil fella, drop me a message via whatsapp or sms and I will contact u from there.

       "102ed9019  Sugar Rush has been with us for a year now. She is an independent girl. it was very easy to litter box train her. Does not dirty/pee/poo anywhere else besides the litter box. She does very well with dogs too (slow and gradual introduction is preferred). She's been really awesome. However, my brother just moved in to my home, is highly allergic to cats, hence the adoption. My dogs and I rescued her from the drain near my house. We hope she'll find a lovely forever home. Looking forward to meeting her new owner soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "1e011d469  Michi was found badly injured two weeks ago, with two big dog bites going through his fur, into his chestbox, very close to his lung and spine, with an serious infectious process going on, in a farm some hours away from KK. Neglecting him would have meant leave him to a slow and painful death. I looked after the cat, and his recovery's been great, but still under antibiotic as the biggest holes hasn't sealed completely, hopefully he'll be healed by the end of this week. I am a traveler, and I must leave Malaysia as my visa expires. We've come all the way to KK to find a real home for him, as I am not allowed to cross into other country with the cat. Michi is male, small size, half-short tailed, about 3 years old, and healthy (no skin deseases). He is quiet, sweet, adorable, not picky with his food, and most importantly LOW MAINTAINANCE. It's hard for me to leave him, as he's the most caring thing I have seen in cats. We had great adventures: we hitch-hiked for two days from somewhere near Tawau, to get here. So you can add \"well traveled\" to his qualities. I must leave KK by Sat 11th Aug. Still after this date, please contact me, as I may not have found a place for him. Do you think you can give him a second chance? You can also help by sending this page to your friends Have a look at more pictures of Michi Terima Kasih!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "0f6b7b928  Rm 50 to save other strays. Introducing Lily the ferocious kitty! Personality: Timid, shy. Takes time to warm up to you. Can really bite and attack if she wants too but mostly she won't do it. Sweet girl at heart and will show it in time. History: I found her all alone while rescuing my dog who hid under the drain. I was watching her for 2 hours in the same time rescuing my dog as she has asked for help for the whole 2 hrs and no mom came. I took her back home after being bitten 2 times. Cleanliness:Already wipe her with petdiartic dry shampoo. Too young to wash her. Tick free. Health: She have a little eye problem which excrete dirt always. But is healing already :) Color: Grey with dark black strip. Current diet is : Wet food Whiskas Jr & Friskies. Estimate age: 2-3 mths or less. Adoption condition: 1) Tell me your experience on handling cat. 2)Spay it when it reach 4-6 mths. 3)Tell me which vet you go. 4) Love her unconditionally. 5) If cannot take care of it anymore due to some reason, please return it back. But no such reason eg: She is already old. Hard to care for it. 6)Give updates whenever you have time. Anyone who is interested please do PM or email me a msg.Thank you for viewing :) If you have any question, you may call me to ask about it. I would try to assist you. You can make appointment to view the kitten too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "687ddcca9  For Adoption 🌻Lassie🌻 Spayed Female, approximately 18 months old Great with kids, a bit cheeky with cats and loves food a bit too much for her own good Needs more work on the leash (if she sees something she is curious about, it's like being dragged by a tractor) Lassie was dumped in Puchong a few months ago and Stanley Saw Boon Leong tried to ignore her like the many strays in the area but could not help but intervene when it became obvious that Lassie, an ex pet, had no idea how to survive on the streets. After falling very ill with tick fever and being attacked and mauled by the strays in the area, Stan and his wife decided she had to get of the streets. I am fostering Lassie and she has been with me for about 2 months. She loves other dogs and will have no trouble going to a family with other dogs. She will chase nervous cats but does not hurt them. Confident cats who stand their ground get their due respect. She is beautiful; I think a cross between Border Collie and Labrador. She learns fast and is eager to please. She is calm indoors but can walk and run for hours if you're the active type. She may knock small children over with her enthusiasm but there isn't an ounce of malice in her and this will subside with age. Moreover she prefers to snuggle up and nap with her people. If you can provide an indoor home, regular walks and exercise, patience to train her and occasional treats AND You are looking for a unique and beautiful family pet who will love you unreservedly, please get in touch at #adoptdontshop #adoptme #adoptionsaveslives #yoycantbuylove #foradoption                          \n",

She is more loving than Snowhite that i rescued last time as she does not make much noise unless when she is hungry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "87aff0121  If you are looking for a smallish medium dog, Morpheus fits the bill. He weighs just around 10 kgs. He is very calm and steady, not noisy but very alert and a good watchdog. Good with cats too. He was found sitting at a park in Damansara Kim in February just after CNY. He wore a blue collar, so we tried to look for his owner but to no avail. Unsure if he ran out during fireworks and is lost or he was abandoned. We hope he can find a good home. No tying up or caging and he is great as an indoor dog. Please call if you can give him a good home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
